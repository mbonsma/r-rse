# Version control: Using Git and GitHub as a sole user (part 1)

Emphasize exercises to practice,
not showing output of git in code chunks (they are a pain to edit afterwards).

Clearly identify which tasks are best accomplished by each interface.

- Using Git integration in RStudio (standard add-commit-history)
- Using Git in the Terminal of RStudio
  - moving in history with checkout
  - creating branches
  - adding and updating remotes
- Setting up GitHub for R package (make use of `usethis`), pushing and pulling


<!---
Moved from syllabus:

And some people still worry that if they make their data and code generally available,
someone else will use it and publish a result they have come up with themselves.
This is almost unheard of in practice,
but that doesn't stop people using it as a scare tactic.
Other people are afraid of looking foolish or incompetent by sharing code that might contain bugs.
This isn't just [impostor syndrome][impostor-syndrome]:
members of marginalized groups are frequently judged more harshly than others,
so being wrong in public is much riskier for them.

## Final exercise

<!-- NOTE: Preferably something linked to working towards completing the project assignments, maybe to be used as a milestone? -->

1. For the project previously used for demonstration in this chapter,
perform the following tasks:
- initialize the repository
- checkout a point in history
- create a new branch
- commit some new changes to the file
- what will happen if you attempt to merge your branches? Merge and find out.

2. For your project assignment,
perform the following tasks,
noting the approach you used 
(Git integration in RStudio, command-line interface, `usethis`):
- initialize the repository
- commit all relevant files (are there any you need to ignore?)
- publish the repository to GitHub
