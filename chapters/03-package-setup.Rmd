# Setting up an R package {#package-setup}

- Describing what a package is and when or why to make one
- Using devtools, usethis for development
- e.g. `use_devtools()` and `use_usethis()`.
- Developing functions
- Basic explanation of what a function is and its components
- Actual process of taking code and converting it into a function will
    be done in next chapter
- Making and using datasets
- Downloading zipf data at this point, using `usethis::use_data_raw()`, write the script to download the data and process into `data/` via `usethis::use_data()`.

## Learning Objectives

* Identify when to create an R package
* Create a new R package using `usethis::create_package()`
* Describe the purpose of the folders and files in a skeleton R package
* Add data to an R package
* Set global defaults to ease package development with devtools and usethis

## About Zipf's Law

We'll create a package (`zipfs`) to analyze a fascinating result in the field of
quantitative linguistics. Zipf’s Law states that the second most common word in
a body of text appears half as often as the most common, the third most common
appears a third as often, and so on. To test whether Zipf’s Law holds for a
collection of classic novels that are freely available from Project Gutenberg,
we write a software package that counts and analyzes the word frequency
distribution in any arbitrary body of text.

## Outline of action steps

* Why create an R package? 

    * Text: Whenever you want to use data or functions over more than one project.
    * Text: Advantages over sharing code and/or data files:
        * Easy for other people to obtain and install
        * Built-in documentation of functions and data
        * Incorporate package-level meta data: authors, version, etc.

* What is an R package?

    * Text: Files that follow the R package conventions. usethis and devtools, 
    designed to help you do this.  
    * Exercise: Install a simple package from GitHub.
    Give some code that: loads package, 
    calls `xxx()` and data `yyy`.  
    Examine structure of GitHub repo.   
    Can you find where is the `xxx()` defined?  `yyy`? 
    Where is the name of the package? 
    
* Creating a package    

    * Text: Where should your package live? What should you call your package?
    * Code: `usethis::create_package()` (maybe also `available::available()`?)
    * Text: `DESCRIPTION` is structured text that describes package, 
    `R/` for R script files that define functions in the package. 
    * Exercise: Repeat steps, e.g. `usethis::create_package("zipfs")`, 
    edit `DESCRIPTION` to have you as author.
 

* Package development workflow
    
    * Text: As an example, add a function to this package. 
    Here, function is provided, next chapter, talks about how you
    write functions. 
    * Code: `use_r()`
    * Text: How do we load the function and check it works?
    * Code: `devtools::load_all()`
    * Exercise: Practice workflow. Make small edit to function, reload, 
    rerun function.
    * Text: `load_all()` emulates installing and loading, but only
    for current session.  Sometimes you want to actually install and load.
    * Code: `devtools::install()`, `library()`
    
* Adding data to a package

    * Text: Data live in `data/` as `.rda` files.  
    * Code: `usethis::use_data("FIXME")` Here with simplified data. Restart, `devtools::load_all()`, `FIXME`
    * Text: Should document how data was created. 
    Put raw data and scripts that end in `usethis::use_data()` in `data-raw/`
    * Code: `use_data_raw()` 
    * Exercise: Provide script for getting dracula text from Gutenberg. 
    Add `dracula` to package.

* R settings that help you as a developer
    
    * Text: `usethis::` `devtools::` get tiresome to type.  Setup to always load.
    * Code: `usethis::use_devtools()` `usethis::use_usethis()`
    * Text: When we restart R, want nothing in environment, no packages loaded, etc.
    * Code: `use_blank_slate()`
    * Text: Other configuration, e.g. to automatically populate `DESCRIPTION`:  https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/usethis-setup.html#store-default-values-for-description-fields-and-other-preferences
    
    
## Final exercise

<!-- NOTE: Preferably something linked to working towards completing the project assignments, maybe to be used as a milestone? -->

1. Use `create_package()` to create a package called FIXME.  

2. Edit the `DESCRIPTION` file to add:

    * yourself as the author, and
    * a one sentence description of the package.

3. Add data to the package

   The raw data and a script to clean the data are provided at: FIXME
   
   Following to steps in Section FIXME 
   to make the FIXME data available as part of the package.
 
You'll know you are finished if:

* Your package can be installed with `install()`. 
* In a fresh R session, 
    after running `library(FIXME)` you can access the data by name.
