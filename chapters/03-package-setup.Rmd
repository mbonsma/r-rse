# Setting up an R package

- Describing what a package is and when or why to make one
    - Use [available](https://github.com/r-lib/available) to make a name (naming is hard).
- Using devtools, usethis for development
- e.g. `use_devtools()` and `use_usethis()`.
- Developing functions
- Basic explanation of what a function is and its components
- Actual process of taking code and converting it into a function will
    be done in next chapter
- Making and using datasets
- Downloading zipf data at this point, using `usethis::use_data_raw()`, write the script to download the data and process into `data/` via `usethis::use_data()`.



## Final exercise {#03-final-exercise}

Complete these tasks as part of the package for your first project assignment.
Refer to the project assignment for exact details on what you are required to
create and on what the package should do. For this exercise, we will be using
an package about weather in Kenya as an example and reference.

1. Decide on a simple but descriptive name for your new package. Use
[available][pkg-available] to see if the name is taken.

2. Use `create_package()` to create a new package. While you can create this
package anywhere on your computer, for now we suggest either your `Desktop/` or
maybe something like `Documents/r-pkgs/`.

3. Open the `DESCRIPTION` file and update the file with:
    * Yourself as the author in the `Authors@R:` field.
    * A one sentence description of the package in the `Title:` field.
    * Two or three sentence summary of the package in the `Description:` field.

4. Add some data to the package. Use `use_data_raw()` to create the `data-raw/`
folder along with a script for cleaning the raw data. Then put the data in this
newly created folder. Write in some simple data cleaning processes in the cleaning
R script and follow the steps in Section FIXME to make the FIXME data available
as part of the package.
 
You'll know you are finished if:

* Your package can be installed with `install()` (or `Ctrl-Shift-B` to build it).
* In a fresh R session, after running `library(FIXME)` you can access the data
by its name.

TODO: Add actions done to kenyaweather package here?
