# Exposing your package to the world with a website:

- Setting up a website (with pkgdown)
- Customizing the themes
- Getting all resources and material organized
- Defining lifecycle of your package and individual functions (with lifecycle)

## Final exercise {#09-final-exercise}

Complete these tasks as part of the package for your first project assignment.
Refer to the project assignment TODO: Add ref to assignment here?
for more details. As with the other final exercises,
we will use the `kenyaweather` package as an example and reference.
Don't forget to add and commit any changes you've made into the Git history
after each task, and pushing to GitHub.

1. Add a `pkgdown` website infrastructure to your package by running 
`usethis::use_pkgdown()` in the R Console.
    - Test that the site can build locally (on your own computer) by running 
    `pkgdown::build_site()`.

2. Search through the potential themes and select which one you'd like for your
package website. Set your selected theme by adding the below in the
`_pkgdown.yml`, replacing the `THEMENAME` with the theme you chose.


    ```yaml
    template:
      params:
        bootswatch: THEMENAME
    ```

3. Customize your website title and description for the homepage by adding
the below to your `_pkgdown.yml` file.

    ```yaml
    home:
        title: TITLE
        description: >
            DESCRIPTION
    ```

4. Organize your package functions into sections in the reference section of
the `_pkgdown.yml` file by using the `pkgdown::template_reference()` function as
the starting point.

5. Given your package is still in development, indicate that it is
"experimental" by using the lifecycle package:
    - Setup lifecycle with `use_lifecycle()`.
    - Add the badge to your README with `use_lifecycle_badge("experimental")`.
    - In each of your R functions, include the experimental lifecycle badge
    in the Roxygen documentation right below the function title.
    
        ```r
        #' `r lifecycle::badge("experimental")`
        ```

6. Configure your repository to use GitHub Actions by adding the appropriate
action with `usethis::use_github_action("pkgdown")`. Commit all the new
changes and push up to GitHub. Check that the Actions have been started
and confirm that the website has been built.
