# Developing documentation and tutorials on usage {#package-documentation}

- Vignettes, README (with rmarkdown and usethis)
- Function documentation (with roxygen2), part 2
    - Markdown functionality with `usethis::use_roxygen_md()`
- Running spell checks and styling (with spelling and styler)

## Final exercise {#08-final-exercise}

Complete these tasks as part of the package for your first project assignment.
Refer to the project assignment TODO: Add ref to assignment here?
for more details. As with the other final exercises,
we will use the `kenyaweather` package as an example and reference.
Don't forget to add and commit any changes you've made into the Git history
after each task.

1. Add the ability to write your roxygen2 documentation using Markdown with 
`usethis::use_roxygen_md()`.

2. Go through your existing function documentations and fill them in more.
Especially focus on completing the `@param`, `@return`, and `@examples` fields.
Then run `document()` (`Ctrl-Shift-D`).

3. Create a README file for your repository by using `use_readme_rmd()`.
    - Edit the `README.Rmd` to include a description of your package and its
    purpose, installation instructions, and one or more examples of how to use it.
    - Knit the `README.Rmd` file so it creates a `README.md` file.

4. Add a vignette to your project package by running `use_vignette("YOURPACKAGENAME")`,
replacing `YOURPACKAGENAME` with the name of your actual project package.
Edit the vignette to include a:
	- Higher-level paragraph describing your package and its purpose.
	- An example of how to use your package, including code, that's more complete
	than what the README might have.
    - Use `knitr` to Knit and preview your vignette.

5. Check the spelling and style of your files in your package by running
`styler::style_pkg()` to restyle your files and `use_spell_check()` to check the
spelling. Fix any problems and if there are any special words, create a
new file in `inst/WORDLIST`, add the word, and run `spelling::update_wordlist()`.
Then re-run these styling and spelling checks to confirm no problems exist anymore.
