# Version control: Workflows around using GitHub (part 2) {#github-workflows}

- Make use of R builtin tools like the usethis pull request helpers
  (and learning how to make use of this yourself)
- E.g. with pr_* functions from usethis
- Using this workflow as a team or as a contributor

## Final exercise

<!-- NOTE: Preferably something linked to working towards completing the project assignments, maybe to be used as a milestone? -->

Complete these tasks as part of the package for your first project assignment:

1. Create a new Issue on your package's GitHub repository about fixing FIXME
function.
2. Using the `pr_*` helpers, create a new branch called `fixing-function` using
`pr_init("fixing-function")`.
3. Make the following changes to the FIXME function:
    - FIXME
4. Add and commit these changes.
5. Push the changes up to GitHub by using `pr_push()`.
    - Create a new Pull Request based on the push.
    - Merge the newly created Pull Request.
6. In your local Git repository, run `pr_finish()` to finish up.

Repeat this process one more time by making changes to:

- FIXME
