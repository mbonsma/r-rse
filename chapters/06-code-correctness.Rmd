# Checking correctness of code

- Using basic debugging strategies ('breakpoints', simple `print()` or `stop()`
calls, `debug()`, `browser()`)
- Unit test (with testthat)
    - While in R script, `use_test()` will create one automatically related to
    the open script.
- Code coverage (with covr)
- With devtools

## Final exercise {#06-final-exercise}

Complete these tasks as part of the package for your first project assignment.
Refer to the project assignment TODO: Add ref to assignment here?
for more details. As with the other final exercises,
we will use the `kenyaweather` package as an example and reference.
Don't forget to add and commit any changes you've made into the Git history.

1. Open one of your R scripts (if you have more than one) in the `R/` folder.
    - In the R Console, type out `use_test()` to create a unit test for the script.

1. Create one test for each of your functions in your package. You should
include tests that:
    - confirm the type of the output
    - confirm the size of the output
    - confirm the values in the output (based on a controlled input)
    - confirm the correct error messages are received when bad input is given

1. Run `test()` in your R Console (or `Ctrl-Shift-T` while in RStudio).

3. Check your code coverage in your package with `package_coverage()`.  Add at
least two tests to improve your code coverage.
