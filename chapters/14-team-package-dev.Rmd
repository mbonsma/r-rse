A team work contract communicates specifically **how** the core group of people who are working together
and gives more detail about the logistics of working together and the expectations you have for each other.
This document will govern your working relationship and if done correctly,
should help you manage and resolve any issues that arise.
MIT's online software construction course has [a good description of what to put in a team work contract](http://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa15/projects/abcplayer/team-contract/).
Some key aspects of the team work contract could be:

- How will work be distributed in a fair and equitable way?
- What are the expected work hours for the project? 
- How often will group meetings occur ([here is a nice article](http://third-bit.com/2018/05/11/meetings.html) on meetings)?
- Will you have meeting agendas and minutes? If so, what will be the system for rotating through these responsibilities?
- What will be the style of working?
    - Will you start each day with [stand-ups](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/standups), or submit a summary of your contributions 4 hours before each meeting? or something else?
- What is the quality of work each team member expects from themselves and each other?
- When are team members not available (e.g., evenings and Sundays because of family obligations).
- And any other similar things that govern your working relationships.

Use this opportunity to use your prior knowledge/experience to improve your teamwork, communication, leadership, and organizational skills.
You will need all of these for your capstone projects (and beyond)!

We recommend that generate the team work contract according to these guidelines

- For 5 minutes, each team member will silently write out 4 different suggestions for the team work contract on their computer.
- Next, paste all suggestions into a common Google doc (or similar)
  and arrange them to put similar suggestions together.
- Spend 10 -15 minutes discussing the suggestions
  and decide which ones you will use for your team contract either by consensus or voting
  (you can of course add new ones at this point if any were missed earlier)
- Add the final contract in a file called `team-contract.md` in the repo root
  (in organizations this file might be kept internal instead of committed to a public repo).
    - These are the principles you adhere to when working.
    - This file should only be updated if there is agreement between team members to do so.

## Final exercises

<!-- NOTE: Preferably something linked to working towards completing the project assignments, maybe to be used as a milestone? -->

### For the first project assignment

These exercises are to be done on the *first project assignment* (the
individual-based one). You won't be able to practice everything that you've
learned during this chapter for this exercise.

1. Set up branch protection for your main branch in your package repository on
GitHub.
2. Create a file called `GOVERNANCE.md` (FIXME: Should this be here?) and write
some general guidelines on:
    - How decisions are made.
    - If and how meetings will be run and held.
    - What culture and standards are valued and how they will be shaped.
    - How conflict/disagreements will be resolved.
3. On your GitHub account, set up 2FA and SSH.
4. In your GitHub package repository settings, create a PAT for working with...
TODO: This item might already be done for setting up GitHub actions.

### For the third project assignment

These exercises are to be done for the *third, team-based project assignment*.

1. Assign one team member to create a GitHub Organization account. 
Have this team member add the other members to the Organization.
    - Set each team member with "Maintainer" permissions.
2. Assign another team member to create a new repository where the
project package will be hosted.
    - This team member will then set up branch protection of the main
    branch.
3. In the new repository, create a new file called `GOVERNANCE.md`.
As a group, decide on and write down:
    - How decisions will be made.
    - How meetings will be run.
    - How disagreements will be resolved.
4. As a group, decide on the tasks that need to be completed and
create Issues of those tasks. Together, assign which team member
will do which tasks.
