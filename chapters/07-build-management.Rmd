# Build management and workflow {#build-management}

- With devtools
- Running local CRAN checks
- General workflow (load_all, test, check)
- Pre-push running test, build, and check
- Continuous integration using GitHub Actions

<!-- NOTE: Preferably something linked to working towards completing the project assignments, maybe to be used as a milestone? -->

## Final exercise

The purpose of this exercise is for the participant to go through a cycle of iteration of:

- 1) checking if their package succeeds with R CMD
- 2) adding a function and the related steps
- 3) check if the package succeeds R CMD with the new additions
- 4) deploy a GitHub Action that performs the R CMD check every time they push to GitHub. 

The individual steps look like this:

<!-- COMMENT: Include check() after each step? -->

1. Check the package in its current state. Fix any notes, warnings, or errors.
  - `devtools::check()`
2. Add a function called `FIXME`
  - `usethis::use_r("FIXME")`
3. Add and build documentation for the `FIXME` function.
  - `devtools::document()`
4. Load all the functions and see if the `FIXME` function works.
  - `devtools::load_all()` 
5. Write and execute tests for the `FIXME` function.
  - `usethis::use_test("FIXME")`
  - `devtoools::test()`
6. Check that the package builds with the new additions
  - `devtools::check()`
7. Deploy a GitHub action to perform a standard R CMD check
  - `usethis::use_github_action_check_standard()`
