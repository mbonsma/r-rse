## Final exercise {#7-final-exercise}

Complete these tasks as part of the package for your first project assignment.
Refer to the project assignment TODO: Add ref to assignment here?
for more details. As with the other final exercises,
we will use the `kenyaweather` package as an example and reference.
Don't forget to add and commit any changes you've made into the Git history.

1. In your project package, check the package by running `check()` (with
`Ctrl-Shift-E` in RStudio). Do you have any notes, warnings, or errors from the
check?
2. Based on the check output, try to fix as many of the notes, warnings, and/or 
errors as possible. Usually `check()` provides informative enough messages that
help guide you to fixing the problems, but not always. Try as best you can.
3. Add a new function to you package by using `use_r()` that does TODO: Add something here?
4. Add roxygen2 documentation for the new function and then run `document()` 
(type `Ctrl-Shift-D` in RStudio).
TODO: This depends on if roxygen is talked about before or after this.
5. Load the function with `load_all()` (`Ctrl-Shift-L`) and see if the function works.
6. Create a new test for the function with `use_test()` and write a basic unit test
testing that the function produces the right output type (e.g. a data frame or vector).
Then run `test()` (`Ctrl-Shift-T`). Fix any errors or warnings that come up and
test again until you get no more errors or warnings.
7. Do another `check()` (`Ctrl-Shift-E`) and try to fix any notes, warnings, or
errors.
8. Set up your Git repository to use a GitHub Action that runs `check()` on
GitHub. Add this setup with `usethis::use_github_action_check_standard()`. Add
and commit this file, then push your changes up to GitHub. Go to the projects 
GitHub repository and check the Actions you just added.
